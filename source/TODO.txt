debug circular occulter masks

Add detector QE and germanium filter features. 

Overall:
 ** improve oversampled calculations 
	Pay attention to source centration very carefully, particularly when changing oversampling factor.
	Should arrange so that pixels directly map one to the other...


 ** better rasterization of pupils - perhaps use GTKAgg or one of the other Agg ones, in a special ipython session, and then dump the output to png

 - offset sources for coronagraphy. 


GUI:
 - derived class for image display which allows mouseover display of the image values, not just coordinates. 
 - derived class for colorbar (or hooks into existing code) to allow dynamic rescaling with windows. 
 - actually do something with stellar spectral types!
 - calculations for large FOV should display the whole thing when calculating...
