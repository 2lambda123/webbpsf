Wavefront class
	knows own spatial scale and sampling, can transform itself via FFT or DFT/SFT
		no, actually this should be a property of the OpticalSystem.

TODO - investigate FFT vs DFT speed just for a regular non-coronagraphic PSF computation.
	use python profiler module. 

	DFT is beneficial in that you can specify the sampling directly - to get a specific pixel e.g. detector pixel size. w/out later interpolation.
