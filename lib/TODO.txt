SFT:
 - rotated/diagonal SFTs

popjw: 
 - downsample to detector pixel resolution. Save as additional FITS image extension. 
 - offset sources for coronagraphy. Lyot mask offsets. 

GUI:
 - add support for downsampling
 - add support for misaligned coronagraphy optics. 
 - derived class for image display which allows mouseover display of the image values, not just coordinates. 
 - derived class for colorbar (or hooks into existing code) to allow dynamic rescaling with windows. 
 - actually do something with stellar spectral types!
 - calculations for large FOV should display the whole thing when calculating...
