Add FITS keywords for data/timeof calculation, user and machine where performed. 
Add object
Add real use of stellar spectral type


Overall:
 ** debug broad band calculations ??

 ** better rasterization of pupils - perhaps use GTKAgg or one of the other Agg ones, in a special ipython session, and then dump the output to png

-----
SFT:
 - rotated/diagonal SFTs

poppy:
 - add interpolation for size-mismatched pupil files using 'ndimage.interpolate.zoom' and then round back to integer pixels.

popjw: 
 - offset sources for coronagraphy. Lyot mask offsets. 


GUI:
 - derived class for image display which allows mouseover display of the image values, not just coordinates. 
 - derived class for colorbar (or hooks into existing code) to allow dynamic rescaling with windows. 
 - actually do something with stellar spectral types!
 - calculations for large FOV should display the whole thing when calculating...
